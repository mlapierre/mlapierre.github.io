* Organise data science project summaries by stages: Data Gathering, Data Preparation, Model Building, Model Validation, and Model Deployment.

* I like automation and optimisation, not for their own sake but because they make things easier. I've called myself lazy, not because I don't want to work but because I detest having to do anything more than necessary. I think of it as contientious laziness; I work hard so that I can get my work done without having to work as hard.

A lot of my software development projects have revolved around this idea. I automated a text-based MUD because most of the game involved griding; repeating the same actions over and over to make tiny incremental improvements to my character so I could take on tougher challenges.

Automating a flash-based game because it was designed to make people pay to get an advantage.

Automating repetitive computer task.

Automating the effort of filtering all the news I consume.

Changing work processes because they involve too many steps, or unnecessary steps, or there's a completely different way that requires less effort and is more effective.

What I want in an employer

* Openly acknowledge that working while sick is bad for everyone. Make sure employees know that not only is it ok to take time off if they're sick - it's encouraged, even if they're only a little sick. Better that they stay home and not pass on their illness to everyone else. Working from home even if only slightly sick should be preferred to going to work. And not just permitted, but officially acknowledged, documented, and communicated.
* A healthy work environment. Plants, ventilation, sunlight, appropriate noise levels, ergonomics.


## Deal breakers

* "hires" unpaid interns. Worse if they charge people to work interns.
