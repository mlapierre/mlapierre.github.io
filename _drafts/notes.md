* I like automation and optimisation, not for their own sake but because they make things easier. I've called myself lazy, not because I don't want to work but because I detest having to do anything more than necessary. I think of it as contientious laziness; I work hard so that I can get my work done without having to work as hard.

A lot of my software development projects have revolved around this idea. I automated a text-based MUD because most of the game involved griding; repeating the same actions over and over to make tiny incremental improvements to my character so I could take on tougher challenges.

Automating a flash-based game because it was designed to make people pay to get an advantage.

Automating repetitive computer task.

Automating the effort of filtering all the news I consume.

Changing work processes because they involve too many steps, or unnecessary steps, or there's a completely different way that requires less effort and is more effective.
